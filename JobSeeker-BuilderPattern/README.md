# Understand Builder Design Patterns using real life example

In software development, managing the complexity of creating large, customizable objects can become a challenge, especially when you have optional fields or need a clear, step-by-step construction process. This is where the Builder Pattern comes to the rescue!

ðŸ’¼ Use Case: JobSeeker Profile Creation for a CRM System

Recently, I implemented the Builder Pattern in Python to construct a complex JobSeeker object. This object had numerous fields, such as personal details, addresses, educational qualifications, work experience, and skills. The Builder Pattern made it easy to assemble this large object incrementally, without overwhelming the client code.

## Key Highlights:

- **Step-by-Step Construction**: Using a builder allows the creation of complex objects in multiple steps, like adding education, work experience, and addresses as needed.
- **Fluent Interface**: The method chaining approach (fluent interface) makes the code highly readable and intuitive.
- **Optional Fields**: Not all fields need to be set, giving you flexibility when dealing with incomplete or optional information.
- **Real-World CRM Example**: In a CRM system, you can use this pattern to handle the creation of profiles with varying degrees of complexity.

```python

class Address:

    def __init__(self, address=None, city=None, pincode=None):
        self.address = address
        self.city = city
        self.pincode = pincode

    def __str__(self):
        return (f'{self.address}, {self.city}, {self.pincode}')

    def getAddress(self):
        return self

class Education:

    def __init__(self, certiName=None, instituteName=None, startYear=None, endYear=None):
        self.certName = certiName
        self.instituteName = instituteName
        self.startYear = startYear
        self.endYear = endYear

    def __str__(self):
        return (f"(Title: {self.certName}, Institute: {self.instituteName}, StartYear:{self.startYear}, EndYear:{self.endYear})")

class Experience:

    def __init__(self,companyName=None,designation=None,startDate=None,endDate=None):
        self.companyName = companyName
        self.designation = designation
        self.startDate = startDate
        self.endDate = endDate

    def __str__(self):
        return (f"(Company Name: {self.companyName}, Designation: {self.designation}, StartYear:{self.startDate}, EndYear:{self.endDate})")

    def getExperience(self):
        return self

```

## JobSeeker

```python

class JobSeeker:

    def __init__(self):
        self.firstName = None
        self.middleName = ""
        self.lastName = None
        self.dob = None
        self.gender = None
        self.permanentAddress = None
        self.currentAddress = None
        self.mobile = None
        self.email = None
        self.education = []
        self.workExperience = []
        self.skills = []

    def __str__(self):

        educations_str = [ str(e) for e in self.education]

        work_experience_str = [str(w) for w in self.workExperience]

        return (f'Name: {self.firstName} {self.middleName} {self.lastName}\n'
                f'DoB: {self.dob} - Gender: {self.gender}\n'
                f'Current Address: {str(self.currentAddress)}\n'
                f'Permanent Address: {str(self.permanentAddress)}\n'
                f'Mobile: {self.mobile}, Email: {self.email}\n'
                f"Education: {educations_str}\n"
                f"Work Experience:{work_experience_str}, \n"
                f"Skills: {self.skills}"
                )

```

## JobSeekerBuilder

```python

class JobSeekerBuilder:

    def __init__(self, firstName, lastName):
        self.jobSeeker = JobSeeker()
        self.jobSeeker.firstName = firstName
        self.jobSeeker.lastName = lastName

    def setMiddleName(self, middleName=""):
        self.jobSeeker.middleName = middleName
        return self

    def setDateOfBirth(self, dob):
        self.jobSeeker.dob = dob
        return self

    def setGender(self, gender):
        self.jobSeeker.gender = gender
        return self

    def setMobile(self, mobile):
        self.jobSeeker.mobile = mobile
        return self

    def setEmail(self, email):
        self.jobSeeker.email = email
        return self

    def setPermenantAddress(self, address, city, pincode):
        self.jobSeeker.permanentAddress = Address(address, city, pincode)
        return self

    def setCurrentAddress(self, address, city, pincode):
        self.jobSeeker.currentAddress = Address(address, city, pincode)
        return self

    def addEducation(self, certiName, instituteName, startYear, endYear ):
        self.jobSeeker.education.append(Education(certiName, instituteName, startYear, endYear))
        return self

    def addExperience(self,companyName,designation,startDate,endDate ):
        self.jobSeeker.workExperience.append(Experience(companyName, designation, startDate, endDate))
        return self

    def addSkill(self, skill):
        self.jobSeeker.skills.append(skill)
        return self

    def build(self):
        return self.jobSeeker
```

## Main function

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":


    jhon = JobSeekerBuilder("Jhon","Peter")\
            .setDateOfBirth('05-10-2000')\
            .setGender("Male")\
            .setMobile("+1-1234567890") \
            .setEmail("jhone@gmail.com") \
            .setPermenantAddress("1023, Oak St, Albert Avenue","Calgary","ADC234") \
            .setCurrentAddress("112, Munroe Park","Regina","DCE324") \
            .addEducation("10th","Govt. Institute","2014","2015") \
            .addEducation("12th","Govt. Institute","2016","2017") \
            .addEducation("B.Sc.(Computer Science)","Royal University","2017","2021") \
            .addExperience("ABCL Software","Trainee Engineer","2021","2023") \
            .addExperience("Craft Solution","Software Engineer","2023","Present") \
            .addSkill("Javascript") \
            .addSkill("SQL") \
            .addSkill("HTML/CSS") \
            .build()


    print(str(jhon))

```

```

This design pattern not only promotes clean and maintainable code but also simplifies object creation when dealing with numerous optional parameters or complex construction logic.
